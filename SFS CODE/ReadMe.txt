			SPACE FREE STYLE
 > This is my first pygame project and this game is inspired by the last 90's
   space invaders, it consists of 10 levels with each level cleared the 
   invaded spaceship is now owed and can be futher used to score more points.
   [WARNING] : 1> I recommend you to restart the game every time you clear a
	       level.
	       2> Postively, please do not alter any of the files or folders 
		of assets and requriment it may lead to misbehavior of game
		or corrupt it too.
	       3> Please keep the assets icon and requriements folder with
